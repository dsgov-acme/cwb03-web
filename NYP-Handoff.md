# Work left to do

As this is a fork of the DSGov framework and with the DSGov framework being purpose-built to working with data that was meant to be short-lived, it didn't meet all the expectations of an application that is very stateful. Also, the DSGov framework was built to have it be update-able by the client themselves. For the NYC Para-transit system where the processes are known ahead of time and the data we would be working with, having a more strongly typed process and data structure would have been the preferred approach. As such, below is an explanation of future improvements/changes we would like to make to the web application:

- Move away from dynamic schema / form builder / transaction framework
  - As described in the remaining work for work-manager, if we move to having strongly typed models, APIs and tables in the supporting backend, we would want to update the web application to match. This would involve creating new services which communicate to the saved location, reservation and rider APIs in the backend to handle basic CRUD and any other functionality, rather than using Transactions.
  - The above also means that we would have custom input form components for creating a saved location and scheduling a new reservation. These would still use the nuverial input components where applicable, but would not use the dsg-form-renderer component / formly to handle rendering the pre-built form.
  - The summary and details components which currently rely on per-component templates would also be phased on in favor of custom components (such as the dsg-ride-summary component) which handle custom formatting and styling of information in the creation and details flows. This allows for the most important data to be highlighted and displayed more centrally, with supporting information (which may be important to gather early in the creation form flow) to be displayed at the end of the summary page.
    - The current dsg-ride-summary component needs to be updated to use a strongly-typed model of a Reservation.
- Move away from Records (which are used to represent Riders) in favor of custom framework similar to as is described above.
- There is additional work required in terms of new features, which is described on [Confluence](https://nuvalence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NYP/pages/1762656278/Remaining+Work). This work can primarily be done as described there but ideally would be completed after the above transition away from the formly component has been completed.
